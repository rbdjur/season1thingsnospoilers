<h1> Student Bio <h1>

<h2 id="Main-bio"> Ronaldo DeGuzman <h2>
    <p> I am new to coding and programming.  
        However, I am very motivated to learn more computer languages and become fluent in them.  
        My background is in healthcare. 
        The goal is to steer my background in the health/medical into an intersection with computer programming.  
        With two backgrounds in formidable fields, I want to create a disruptive force, pairing my new technology background with the medical and healthcare industry.

        One of my hobbies are music production/egineering.  I started making music at 17 years old.
        However, I stopped within a year.  I regret distancing myself from music production/engineering 
        as I focused on playing football in college and school.  After 7 years, I realized I found myself 
        gravitating towards this hobby of mine without effort and awareness.
